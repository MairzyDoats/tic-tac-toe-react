# Tic Tac Toe React App

[Try it out here](https://click-tac-toe.netlify.app/)

Tic Tac Toe is a simple React.js application that is the classic game as we all know it. You have to click tiles to fill three lines vertically, horizontally or diagonally to win.

## How it's done

It is quite simple visually while the certain states is determined by CSS classes that get added to each tile. A hover class determines who's turn it is and if a tile was claimed already. A modal shows the outcome of the game if a player has won or if all the tiles have been claimed and the game comes to a draw.

## Next steps?

A possible extension would be to make this game single player so the app has a response to the player's choices. Another possibility would be to implement a multiplayer feature across the web with WebSockets.
